### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to structure a recipe page using HTML and CSS. I practiced using semantic HTML5 elements to give meaning to the content and improve accessibility. I also utilized CSS flexbox and grid for layout design, ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes.
